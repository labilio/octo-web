// React binding for the collaborative whiteboard session (board counterpart of useCollabEditor).
//
// A board-level registry keyed by `${uid}::${documentName}` makes account / board switches isolate
// naturally and survives StrictMode's double-invoked effects (idempotent create + refcount), the
// same shape useCollabEditor uses for the doc editor.
//
// Identity-first, mirroring CollabEditor.create: the collab token is PRIMED before the provider is
// built, so the authoritative WS origin (`collabWsUrl`) and the initial role/epoch are known up
// front (P1-3 / P1-4). This replaces the previous synchronous build that derived the WS origin from
// the page host and had no pre-connect role. If priming fails (offline / a backend that predates the
// contract) we fall back to the origin-derived `WS_ENDPOINT` and no pre-connect role — the board
// then fails closed (read-only) until an authoritative role arrives, and the provider's own token
// getter retries issuance on connect.
//
// Token contract: the board reuses the doc editor's collab-token flow — POST /docs/collab-token
// with the whiteboard documentName `octo:{space}:{folder}:wb:{board}`. The backend's unified WS
// router already recognises the 5-segment `:wb:` key (see @octo/whiteboard-schema name codec), so
// the same endpoint issues a token for a board. No board-specific endpoint is introduced here.
